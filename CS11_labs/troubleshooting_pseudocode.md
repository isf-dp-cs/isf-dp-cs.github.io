## Variables
In Pseudocode, all variable names must be written with capital letters. We use a single `=` for variable assignment.
```java
X = 1 // integer
NAME = "Freddy" // string
IS_RAINING = false // boolean
```
## Input/Output
```java
// Example of a pseudocode loop
loop VAR from 1 to 2
   output VAR
end loop
```
### Practice Input/Output

## If/Then
In Pseudocode, every `if` must be paired with a `then` and `end if`.  A single `=` is also used for comparison (in addition to a variable assignment).
```java
  UNIT = input("Type a unit")    

  if  UNIT = "km"  then
     output "1 km = 1000 m = 0.6 miles"
  end if

  if  UNIT = "mi"  then
     output "1 mi = 5280 ft = 1.6 km"
  end if

  if  UNIT = "ft"  then
     output "1 ft = 12 in = 30.5 cm"
  end if

  if  UNIT = "liter"  then
     output "1 liter = 1000 ml = 1/3 gallon"
     output "Don't forget that IMPERIAL GALLONS"
     output "are different than US GALLONS"
  end if
```




## For Loops
```java
// Example of a pseudocode loop
loop VAR from 1 to 2
   output VAR
end loop
```

## While Loops
```java
// Example of a pseudocode loop
loop VAR from 1 to 2
   output VAR
end loop
```

## Exercises

ðŸ’» Write pseudocode that creates the following output

```console
Enter number 10
Sum is:  55
```

```shell
Enter number 10
Sum is:  55
```
